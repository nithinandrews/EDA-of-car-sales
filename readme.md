    "# Automotive Data Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository presents a detailed analysis of an extensive automotive dataset comprising 558,837 records and 16 columns. The project delves into various aspects of vehicle data, including pricing, condition, and odometer readings, to uncover insightful patterns and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis**: The analysis highlights the close relationship between Manufacturer's Market Report (MMR) and Selling Price, with observations of high odometer readings and vintage cars from 1982.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed significant issues including missing values in the Transmission column (13%), inconsistencies in the Condition column (values like 45, 59), and standardized entries in the Body column to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- **Visualizations**: Developed comprehensive visualizations using histograms, scatter plots, and bar plots. Histograms reveal the distribution of Selling Prices and Odometer Readings, while scatter plots examine the correlation between Selling Price and MMR. Bar plots provide insights into average Selling Prices by Brand and Transmission type.\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**: Employed heatmaps to identify correlations between numerical features, revealing strong interrelationships and multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brand and Body Type**: Identified top brands (Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan, Toyota, Dodge) and body types (Sedan, SUV) based on frequency.\n",
    "- **Price and Condition**: Analyzed the relationship between vehicle condition ratings and Selling Prices, with a notable concentration of prices between $10,000-$20,000.\n",
    "- **Geographical Distribution**: Examined car distribution across states, with Florida and California having the highest number of entries.\n"
